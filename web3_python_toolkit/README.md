### lexicon

##### providers
 
- providers are how libraries such as `web3.py` talk to the blockchain. 
- providers take `JSON-RPC` requests and return responses
- the most common ways to connect to your node are:
   - IPC (uses local filesystem, fastest and most secure)
   - Websockets (works remotely, faster than HTTP)
   - HTTP (more nodes support it)
