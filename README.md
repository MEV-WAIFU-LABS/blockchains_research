### my research notebooks:

<br>
    

* [Extracting on-data from a list of Ethereum public addresses](on-chain-data-by-address):
    * Given a list of public addresses, extract the current token balance, and parse the transaction history for token transfers/swaps.

<br>

* [Leveraging Uniswap subgraph to extract token pair information](uniswap-data):
    * Utilize The Graph Explorer to access the Uniswap subgraph and analyze the UNI and WETH token pair data. 

<br>
    

* [Retrieving DAO tokens and pools data](dao-data):
    * Utilize The Graph Explorer to access the Uniswap subgraph and analyze the data related to a list of DAO tokens.


<br>
    

* [Leveraging Moralis API to extract on-chain transactions, tokens, events, defi](moralis-tokens-and-txs):
    * Moralis API is a nice wrapper for several on-chain calls that would instead use several other native APIs and tools. We list the most useful features here.


<br>
    

* [Messari API for token market data](messari-assets-data):
    * Utilize [Messari API](https://messari.io/api) to retrieve market data for a list of tokens.

### my algorithmic trading stuff:

* [Trading strategies](trading-bots-and-scripts/)
    * A set of scripts for some of my statistical trading games.

### my library + scripts for on-chain queries:

* [eth-python-scripts](eth-python-scripts)
    * A set of python library and scripts that I am accumulating as I investigate Ethereum:
        - a suitable wrapper for web3 
        - get contracts deployed to mainnet and testnets
        - get reserve history by block number for a pair of addresses

* [eth-rust-scripts](eth-rust-scripts)
    * A set of rust library and scripts that I am accumulating as I investigate Ethereum:
        - a suitable wrapper for web3
