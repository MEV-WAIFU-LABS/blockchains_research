### lexicon

* providers: how libraries such as web3 talk to the blockchain. providers take JSON-RPC requests and return responses, usually done by submitting the request to an http or ipc socket based server.
* the most common ways to connect to your node are:
   -IPC (uses local filesystem: fastest and most secure)
Websockets (works remotely, faster than HTTP)
HTTP (more nodes support it)
